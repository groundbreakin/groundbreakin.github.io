## First Header



```
within three quotes
```


## Usage

`single quotes does this` 

### Subheader

Bower offers several ways to install packages:

```bash
# Using the dependencies listed in the current directory's bower.json
bower install
# Using a local or remote package
bower install <package>
# Using a specific Git-tagged version from a remote package
bower install <package>#<version>
```



Using `bower list` will show all the packages that are installed locally.


### Finding packages

To search for packages registered with Bower:

```
bower search [<name>]
```





* `endpoint`: `twitter/flight`
* `organization`: `twitter`
* `package`: `flight`

**N.B.** To run your own Bower Endpoint for custom packages that are behind a
firewall, you can use a simple implementation of the [Bower
Server](https://github.com/bower/bower-server).




## A note for Windows users

To use Bower on Windows, you must install
[msysgit](http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/) correctly. Be sure to check the
option shown below:
